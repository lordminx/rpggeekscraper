# RPG Geek Scraper
The goal is to design a scraper to pull rpggeek.com RPG data and pull it into a CSV. This is an experiment and learning experience that will be heavily based on the excellent work of TheWeatherman who has done work using the Board Game Geek API and designed a scraper to mine its data here: https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/tree/master/boardgamegeek
